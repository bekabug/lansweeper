## LANSweeper Uptime Report

If you're not rebooting Windows, you're not patching. The default uptime report is ok but I wanted a few things.

1. The devices with an uptime of greater than 30 days are in red,
2. The username and the display name are both shown,
3. The display name is an email link with the device name in the subject.

I'll likely extend this into a python app that can send emails for me but for now 
it's convenient to have them sent through the email client.
